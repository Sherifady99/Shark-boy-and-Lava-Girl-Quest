We received a dataset that included a lot of information about every documented shark attack since the 1800s, so we took the following approach.
Brainstormed initial theories on dataset.
Narrowed our theories down to 2 core hypothesis.
Proceeded with Data cleaning techniques.
Breaking down each hypothesis into separated analysis.
Proved/disproved our hypothesis.

We decided on the following 2 hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Provoked shark attacks are more fatal than unprovoked.
Hypothesis 2: Great white sharks are the most fatal species.
